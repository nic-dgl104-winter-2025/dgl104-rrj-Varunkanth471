##  Section 1: Design Patterns

###  Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems. They don’t represent exact code, but rather general approaches that developers can adapt to various situations to improve code scalability, flexibility, and readability (Gamma et al., 1994).

---

###  Key Concepts

####  What Are Design Patterns?

- Reusable solutions to common programming problems.
- Blueprints, not specific implementations.
- Improve maintainability and readability.
- Offer a shared vocabulary among developers (Freeman & Robson, 2004).

###  Activities Completed

#### 1. **Four Common Design Patterns**

#####  Singleton Pattern  
- **Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access.  
- **Use Case**: Centralized resources like DB managers or loggers.  
- **Example**: Logging system.  
> *"The Singleton pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single object"* — Gamma et al., 1994

#####  Factory Method Pattern  
- **Purpose**: Define an interface for creating objects but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Use Case**: When object creation logic varies.  
- **Example**: UI toolkit that supports multiple operating systems.  
> *"Factory methods let a class defer instantiation to subclasses"* — Gamma et al., 1994

#####  Observer Pattern  
- **Purpose**: Enable multiple objects to observe and respond to state changes in another object.  
- **Use Case**: Real-time updates across multiple components.  
- **Example**: Chat apps, stock tickers.  
> *"Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects"* — Gamma et al., 1994

#####  Strategy Pattern  
- **Purpose**: Enable selecting an algorithm at runtime from a family of algorithms.  
- **Use Case**: Multiple interchangeable algorithms.  
- **Example**: Choosing different sorting techniques.  
> *"Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable"* — Gamma et al., 1994

#### 2. **Understanding the Application Development Coding Project**

I reviewed the [Application Development Coding Project assignment](#) and rubric. It helped me understand my potential contributions, the grading criteria, and gave me more confidence. I also reviewed the [Reflection Journal Guide on GitHub](#), which provided a clearer direction for completing this journal.

#### 3. **How to Contribute to Open Source**

Open source isn’t just about code—it includes design, documentation, issue triaging, and more (Fogel, 2005). Beginners can start with small tasks to build familiarity.

> *"The success of an open-source project is heavily influenced by its community, not just the code"* — Raymond, 2001

---

#### 4. **Finding a Project to Contribute To**

I explored the platform [Up for Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/) to find beginner-friendly open-source issues. I found a project:

- **Repo**: [agauniyal/wireframe](https://github.com/agauniyal/wireframe/labels/help%20wanted)  
- **Description**: A tool for creating website/app mockups  
- **Issue Chosen**: *Styling the footer*

**Why This Issue?**
- **Skill Match**: Involves HTML/CSS.
- **Beginner Friendly**: Easy to isolate and contribute to.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Understand how front-end tools work.

##Summary

Design patterns are like cheat codes for writing clean, reusable code. They're not actual code, but blueprints for solving common problems in software development (Gamma et al., 1994).

###Why Are They Important?
- They **enhance maintainability**, **encourage reuse**, and **simplify collaboration**.
- They help devs avoid reinventing the wheel.
- They provide a **universal language** for common challenges.

| Creational      | Object creation techniques             | Singleton, Factory        |
| Structural      | Composition of classes/objects         | Adapter, Decorator        |
| Behavioral      | Communication between objects          | Observer, Strategy        |
