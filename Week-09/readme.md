# Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable fragments of code that provide solutions to well-understood coding problems. While they do not perform specific functions on their own, they help create maintainable and scalable code. These patterns are widely recognized by experienced programmers, improving code readability and long-term maintainability.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Design Patterns?

- Reusable solutions to common programming problems.
- Not actual code, but structured approaches to problem-solving.
- Improve code maintainability and readability.
- Recognizable by developers, making collaboration easier.


# Activities Completed
## 1. Four Common Design Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

- **Purpose:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Use Case:** When you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to one object.
- **Example:** Database connections or logging classes where a single instance is needed throughout the application.
  
### 2. Factory Method Pattern

- **Purpose:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Use Case:** When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create or wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.

- **Example:** UI frameworks where different types of buttons (like Windows or MacOS) are created depending on the platform.  

### 3. Observer Pattern
- **Purpose:** Allows a subject to notify its observers of any state changes without knowing who or what those observers are.

- **Use Case:** When you need to implement a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen to and react to events or state changes from another object.

- **Example:** Implementing a real-time chat application where new messages are broadcasted to multiple users.

### 4. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose:** Defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime.

- **Use Case:** When a class has multiple methods for performing an action and needs to switch between them dynamically.

- **Example:** Sorting strategies where different sorting algorithms can be used based on input size or data characteristics.

### 2. Went Through APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT CODING PROJECT ASSIGNMENT &  RESEARCH AND REFLECTION GUIDE.

*  I have went through the ***Application Development Coding Project*** and helped me to understand what I can contribute for the project and the Rubric gave me a what need to be done and found little bit confidence and also checked the ***Research and Reflection Journal Guide*** on GitHub, got a clear point how to complete ny Journal.

### 3. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE 

* Section-2 

## Contributing to Open Source

Open source contribution extends far beyond coding, offering opportunities for involvement. While coding is valuable, projects often need help with documentation, design, organizing. For example, improving documentation can be as important as writing code. This variety allows anyone, regardless of technical skill, to contribute meaningfully. Starting with basics tasks can also help build relationships and confidence, paving the way for future coding contributions. Open source isn’t limited to software projects can include books,etc.,. This makes open source accessible to all.

* Section 4

## Finding a project to contribute to.

After going through the Section 4 in the "How to contribute" i went and explored "Open Source Friday" to find any issue relatd to our project and found out https://up-for-grabs.net/ Up for Grabs website to Find any issue.

- Found an issue called "Wireframe".
- Link to the GitHub repo. - https://github.com/agauniyal/wireframe/labels/help%20wanted
- In the repo. did not found more then 5 issues posted and the issues were "help wanted" issues ranging from refactoring the framework to a custom tag-based system, styling the footer, and adding a navigation element which offers an opportunities for both technical and design contributions.

### 4. Identify Issues to Support

- Found an issue in the agauuniyal/wireframe repository that I think would be a great fit for me to tackle as an open-source contribution. The project is a wireframing tool designed to help create prototypes or mockups of websites and applications pretty cool for anyone into UI/UX or front-end devlopment The specific issue I’m eyeing is styling the footer of the application.
 
# Why this issue?
- Skill Match: It involves CSS and HTML, areas I’m comfortable with and enjoy working on.
- Beginner-Friendly: Styling the footer seems like a contained task perfect for someone like me who’s relatively new to open-source. I won’t need to dive too deep into the whole codebase to get started.
- Learning Opportunity: It’ll let me sharpen my front-end skills while getting familiar with how this wireframing tool is built.
