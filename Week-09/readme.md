# Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable fragments of code that provide solutions to well-understood coding problems. While they do not perform specific functions on their own, they help create maintainable and scalable code. These patterns are widely recognized by experienced programmers, improving code readability and long-term maintainability.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Design Patterns?

- Reusable solutions to common programming problems.
- Not actual code, but structured approaches to problem-solving.
- Improve code maintainability and readability.
- Recognizable by developers, making collaboration easier.


# Activities Completed
## Four Common Design Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern

- **Purpose:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Use Case:** When you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to one object.
- **Example:** Database connections or logging classes where a single instance is needed throughout the application.
  
### 2. Factory Method Pattern

- **Purpose:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Use Case:** When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create or wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.

- **Example:** UI frameworks where different types of buttons (like Windows or MacOS) are created depending on the platform.  

### 3. Observer Pattern
- **Purpose:** Allows a subject to notify its observers of any state changes without knowing who or what those observers are.

- **Use Case:** When you need to implement a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen to and react to events or state changes from another object.

- **Example:** Implementing a real-time chat application where new messages are broadcasted to multiple users.

### 4. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose:** Defines a family of algorithms and allows them to be interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime.

- **Use Case:** When a class has multiple methods for performing an action and needs to switch between them dynamically.

- **Example:** Sorting strategies where different sorting algorithms can be used based on input size or data characteristics.

### What I understood.

1. I have went through the ***Application Development Coding Project*** and helped me to understand what I can contribute for the project and the Rubric gave me a what need to be done and found little bit confidence and also checked the ***Research and Reflection Journal Guide*** on GitHub, got a clear point how to complete ny Journal.

2. Spent some time to the activity **What to Contribute** 
- **Contributing to Open Source** involves more than just code. It can include:
  - **Reporting bugs:** Identifying and reporting issues to help improve the project.
  - **Writing documentation:** Providing clear, useful documentation for users and developers.
  - **Designing:** Contributing to UI/UX design, which is essential for user-facing projects.
  - **Answering questions:** Participating in discussions and helping other contributors.
  - **Testing:** Identifying issues or improving test coverage.

## Reflection: How I Plan to Contribute

Based on what Iâ€™ve learned, I would like to start contributing in the following ways:

1. **Documentation Contributions**  
   - Many projects lack proper documentation. I plan to help by improving README files, tutorials, and project instructions.
2. **Helping Others in the Community**  
   - Engaging in discussions, answering beginner questions, and helping with code reviews.
